### Overview

This repository contains the code used in the study: Mondragon-Estrada et al., [Noncoding variants and sulcal patterns in congenital heart disease: Machine learning to predict functional impact](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(24)02934-1), iScience (2025), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.111707.

The main analyses were:

*   Variant score prediction using deep learning models [Basenji2](https://github.com/calico/basenji) and [Enformer](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/enformer)
*   Weighted correlation network analysis ([WGCNA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WGCNA/index.html))
*   Gene set enrichment analysis ([clusterProfiler](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/clusterProfiler))

--------
### Requirements 

#### Hardware requirements
Deep learning predictions were carried out in GNU/Linux workstations with 128 GB of RAM and NVIDIA GPUs.

#### OS requirements 
Scripts were executed on `GNU/Linux Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (Focal Fossa)`. Deep learning models are implemented in `Python3` and their corresponding usage and requirements can be seen in their repositories. WGCNA and GO enrichment analysis were performed in `R 4.1.2`.

--------
### Setup and usage

Basenji2's predictions were obtained using the script [predict_scores_b.sh](https://github.com/MortonLabBCH/brain-ncdnv-chd/blob/main/scripts/predict_scores_b.sh). Instructions for installing Basenji2 and creating a conda environment are available in the original [Basenji2 GitHub repository](https://github.com/calico/basenji).

Enformer's predictions were obtained using the script [predict_scores_e.py](https://github.com/MortonLabBCH/brain-ncdnv-chd/blob/main/scripts/predict_scores_e.py). Instructions for installing Basenji2 and creating a virtual environment are available in the original [Enformer GitHub repository](https://github.com/google-deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/enformer).

For processing and statistical steps performed in Python3, we recommed creating a third virtual environment with this [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MortonLabBCH/brain-ncdnv-chd/blob/main/scripts/processing/requirements.txt).

```shell
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For analyses done in R, the following packages are required:

*   Bioconductor packages:
    *   WGCNA
    *   clusterProfiler
    *   biomaRt
    *   org.Hs.eg.db
    *   GenomicRanges
    *   ChIPpeakAnno
    *   TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene

*   CRAN packages:
    *   ggplot2
    *   dplyr
    *   RColorBrewer
    *   ppcor

They all can be installed using the following commands in R:

```R
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("WGCNA")
BiocManager::install("clusterProfiler")
BiocManager::install("biomaRt")
BiocManager::install("org.Hs.eg.db")
BiocManager::install("GenomicRanges")
BiocManager::install("ChIPpeakAnno")
BiocManager::install("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene")

# For installing ggplot and dplyr, it is easier to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse") 
# Alternatively, each package can be installed individually with the following commands:
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")

install.packages("RColorBrewer")
install.packages("ppcor")
```
